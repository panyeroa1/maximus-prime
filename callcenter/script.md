Speaker 1: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to the channel.  
Today we’re diving into something that could completely change how businesses handle customer service.  
It’s called the Eburon Voice Studio.

Speaker 1: If you’ve ever wanted to build, test, and launch AI voice agents without juggling a bunch of different tools… this is it.  
Eburon Voice Studio is secure, all-in-one, and honestly, a game changer.  
You can create everything from a simple IVR menu to a human-like agent that connects to your live data.  
All inside one dashboard.

Speaker 1: So grab a coffee, settle in, and let’s get into it.  
I’ll show you what it does, why it matters, and how to build your own agent in just a few minutes.

Speaker 1: First, what is Eburon Voice Studio?  
Think of it as a workshop. A full environment for creating customer service voice agents.  
Not just a prompt. Not just a toy.  
It’s built to manage the entire agent lifecycle from start to finish.

Speaker 1: The goal is simple—turn an idea into a reliable business tool.  
It even works offline, thanks to local storage.  
When you’re online, it syncs seamlessly with the cloud.  
And for brainpower, it uses Eburon AI.  
That means state-of-the-art speech, conversation, and transcription.

Speaker 1: Let’s take a tour.  
First stop: Call Logs and Analysis.

Speaker 1: Every call—test or live—shows up here.  
Not just who called or how long it lasted.  
You get a transcript that syncs with the audio.  
Play it back, and the words highlight in real time.  
Perfect for quality checks.

Speaker 1: And here’s the kicker—Call Analysis.  
One click, and the AI breaks down what happened.  
What the customer wanted, how it was handled, even their sentiment.  
It’s like having a personal QA analyst for every call.

Speaker 1: Next, the Voices and TTS Studio.  
This is where you decide how your brand actually sounds.  

Speaker 1: There’s a library of voices you can preview instantly.  
Or you can clone a voice from an audio sample.  
Then, in the TTS Studio, you fine-tune speech with SSML.  
Pitch, speed, emphasis—whatever it takes to sound natural.  
And it keeps your history so you can compare versions.

---

Speaker 1: Now, the Agents Hub.  
This is the heart of the studio.  

Speaker 1: Each agent has a name, description, and a chosen voice.  
But the core is the System Prompt.  
That’s the agent’s constitution—its personality, rules, and goals.  
You can even define how it handles multiple languages, making your agent truly global.
You can even connect it to external tools for live data.

---

Speaker 1: Of course, smart agents need information.  
That’s where the CRM Dashboard comes in.  

Speaker 1: It’s a real CRM built right into the studio.  
You can search customer records, edit bookings, import or export data.  
And yes, agents can actually use that data live during calls.

---

Speaker 1: There’s also a Chatbot with Developer Mode.  
In normal mode, you can ask it questions or get help with tasks.  
Flip on Developer Mode, and it becomes a coder.  
Ask for a landing page, and it generates a full HTML file, previewed live in the simulator.  
That’s rapid prototyping at its best.

Speaker 1: Let’s build one together.  
Step one: Create a new agent.  
We’ll call him Captain Coffee.  
Pick a voice, and add the prompt: “You are a friendly barista who helps customers with orders. Feel free to use a little humor!”  
Save it.

Speaker 1: Step two: Start a test call.  
Open the dialer and launch the web demo.  
It starts with a realistic IVR.  
Press one, and we’re connected to Captain Coffee.

Speaker 1: Step three: Talk to the agent.  
“Hey, do you have any dairy-free milk?”  
And look at that—it answers:  
“We’ve got oat, almond, and soy milk. Which one would you like for your latte?”  
Live transcript, live audio, background actions.  
Smooth.

Speaker 1: Step four: Review the call.  
Back to the logs, pull it up, hit analyze.  
Now you see exactly how the agent performed.  
Complete loop—build, test, review.

---

Speaker 1: So why does Eburon Voice Studio matter?  
Four reasons.  

Speaker 1: One: it’s all in one.  
Two: the build-test-review cycle is fast.  
Three: the AI is powerful—thanks to Eburon AI at the core.  
Four: it works both offline and online. Reliable by design.

Speaker 1: For developers, it’s a full lab for voice AI.  
For businesses, it’s a direct path to human-like customer service at scale.
